# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6


### Overview
Ever thought about planning a trip because the location had the most perfect weather? I think we all have, but determing what the best location for desired weather may have presented a challenge in that planning.  Now, with the completion of this work, you can define your ideal temperatures. From there, once you see a map with locations in your desired weather parameters, you can select four cities for your itinerary and be presented with a final itinerary map giving the final details.

### Summary

Here is a sample map based on the parameters of 62 to 85 degree temperatures.

I added an additional step in the challenge, allowing the user to input cities of choice based on the weather map.  Doing this makes the code reusable because the cities do not have to be edited for a new map. Simply zoom in on the map and destination of choice, click on markers to see the city title and enter that information as prompted for a complete itinerary.
